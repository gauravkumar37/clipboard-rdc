This project aims to simplify this need. It does this by encoding the file on a server, copying it to clipboard, decoding the file on host computer, and finally by saving it to disk- all on the fly.\r\n\r\nCOMPILING\r\n---------\r\nJust import the project into eclipse.\r\nAll the required libraries and sources have been included in the project.\r\n\r\nEXECUTING\r\n---------\r\nExecute the class file com.hcl.ClipboardRdc\r\n\r\nDISTRIBUTABLE\r\n-------------\r\nA distributable jar has also been packed inside the /dist folder.","name":"Clipboard-rdc"}
