INTRO
-----
Easily share files via Clipboard of Remote Desktop Connections (RDC)

Currently, windows users have no way of transferring files to or frmo remote desktop connections (RDC). This project aims to simplify this need. It does this by encoding the file on a server, copying it to clipboard, decoding the file on host computer, and finally by saving it to disk- all on the fly.

COMPILING
---------
Just import the project into eclipse.
All the required libraries and sources have been included in the project.

EXECUTING
---------
Execute the class file com.hcl.ClipboardRdc

DISTRIBUTABLE
-------------
A distributable jar has also been packed inside the /dist folder.
